# AutoSizingDatePicker
UIDatePicker does not return valid a intrinsic size, which is hard to support Dynamic Type Accessibility.

AutoSizingDatePicker overrides `intrinsicContentSize` for better auto layout support.

# How to use
## Storyboard 
Set a placeholder for intrinsic size like below, as the overridden intrinsic size is calculated at run time, not working at Interface Builder.

## Auto layout programmatically
In an Auto Layout environment, the text field or text areaâ€™s preferred height will be reflected in `-intrinsicContentSize`. So just set the position of it.
